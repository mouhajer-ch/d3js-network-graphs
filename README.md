# d3js-network-graphs

## Description

Goal, create a network graph that links ParentID and ID together if I present you a table with them.

- Export info from table in a CSV format that can be processed by the page.
- ParentID should be the first field on the CSV file and the ID should be the second field.
- No orphans ParentID/source should be present.
- Over 10k of data the graph will be hard to see and useless for the user to catch any important information.
